# HoldCrew Casting — project guide

Commercial-casting curation for **production** (director / EP / PM): import a casting director's
submissions, organise candidates into roles, run the selection lifecycle, present Selects to the
client, and book the winner into the HoldCrew Job Log.

**A separate HoldCrew product, sibling to HoldCrew Reels.** Built *from* the reels playbook (same
Node/SQLite/Wasabi/tokenized-viewer/upload patterns + dark-amber design), kept together with reels
only via a shared account/subscription registry. Off Google: real DB + Wasabi, not Sheets/Drive.

> **Read [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) first** — full architecture, data model, domain notes, build order,
> and locked decisions. This file is the quick orientation.

## Status (2026-07-07)
Greenfield. **Tasks 1–4 done + verified locally; not yet on the box.**
- **1 scaffold** — repo, config, SQLite schema (5 tables), tenant resolve, `/api/health`.
- **2 tenant + auth** — `src/auth.js` per-tenant password gate + HMAC cookie bound to slug;
  `scripts/onboard-tenant.js`.
- **3 data layer** — `src/casting.js` board get-or-create + roles/candidates/assignments CRUD,
  tenant-scoped. `scripts/smoke.js` = 19/19 incl. isolation.
- **4 front-end** — `public/casting.html` (the approved board) wired to the real API; served gated
  at `/casting.html?job=<suffix>`; `public/css/casting.css` self-contained; `public/login.html`.
- DNS wildcard `*.casting.holdcrew.com` created (Eric). **NOT DONE:** box bring-up (Caddy block →
  :4100, systemd unit, onboard real tenants), git init, media/Wasabi (task 6), CSV import (task 5),
  client presentation (task 7). Local dev DB has test tenants upshot/iq (test passwords).

## Stack / infra (target)
- Node/Express, own port **:4100** (reels is :4000). systemd unit + Caddy wildcard
  `*.casting.holdcrew.com` — NOT set up yet.
- **SQLite** (better-sqlite3, WAL) at `data/casting.db`; `user_version` migrations (reels idiom).
- **Wasabi** dedicated bucket **`holdcrew-casting`**, reusing the `upshot-reels-app` sub-user (scoped
  casting-bucket policy). Keys `<tenant>/<job>/<candidate>/{headshot.jpg,tape.mp4}`.
- Tenants = HoldCrew production companies (seeded from the company registry — task 2).

## Source map
- `src/config.js` env + settings · `src/db.js` schema + bootstrap · `src/tenant.js` subdomain→tenant +
  media-key helper · `src/ids.js` id/token minting · `src/server.js` boot + health + static.
- `public/index.html` placeholder landing (casting board arrives task 4).

## Conventions (from reels)
- Tenant isolation is the #1 risk — every data query must filter by tenant + project.
- Migrations: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for base; `PRAGMA user_version` gates for later changes.
- Commit = done. End commits with the Co-Authored-By trailer.
